This paper explores the idea that AI technologies for healthcare settings might not be an instant panacea. It discusses how the translation from research to clinical implementation is a complex technical, ethical, and regulatory challenge. Primarily, exploring how best to validate AI tool's performance at clinical tasks which are often from quantitative evaluation using statistical metrics.
