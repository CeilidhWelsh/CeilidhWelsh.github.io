Co-authoring this chapter with Susana Roman-Garcia, Natalie Zelenka and Irma xx, remains one of my favourite experiences of my ongoing collaboration with The Turing Way. This chapter explores the Data Hazards ethical framework for understanding and mitigating data risk associated with AI research and AI applications. It also includes a case study for organising and running an EDI compliant, accessible event for hosting a one-day hybrid symposium for gathering people together to explore integrating data ethics and reproducibility into research projects.
