This paper explores the question: How do we create ethical AI solutions that improve patient outcomes and experiences, without perpetuating existing risks and introducing new ones? Through small-group and one-to-one discussions held with patients, healthcare professionals, and researchers, four key approaches emerged: understanding and prioritising need, defining shared language, mutual learning and continued co-creation and AI democratisation.
