## <span style="color: #1A3B33;">PhD in Computational Oncology (Oct 2020 – Dec 2024)</span>
### Towards a Unified Model for Predicting Radiotherapy Effects
### Funded by Cancer Research UK

Supervised by [Dr Gillian C. Barnett](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/staff-directory/dr_gill_barnett/) and [Dr Raj Jena](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/staff-directory/dr-raj-jena/). 

  * Utilised statistical and machine learning methods to predict radiotherapy treatment response, conducting collaborative interdisciplinary research with clinicians, AI researchers, ethicists, patients, and publics
  *	Independently designed and implemented a reproducible pipeline using FAIR data principles, ensuring accountability, explainability, and transparency of algorithm development and research objectives
  *	Mapped out and utilised ethical frameworks for evaluating and addressing medical data risks and ethical concerns associated with the project’s goals, in the context of AI healthcare implementation 
  *	Shaped and informed the project’s execution through qualitative focus-group methods to explore patients’ lived experiences and perspectives
  *	High-quality research outputs, from patient-facing collaborations to research publications, informing UK Government policy development on AI medical device regulation 

## Enrichment Scheme, Alan Turing Institute London, (Oct 2022 – Oct 2023)
  *	Worked with an international community of leading researchers in AI methods and applications, data ethics and governance, and AI policy implementation 

## Integrated Masters in Physics, University of Exeter (Sept 2016 – June 2020)
  * First Class Honours (83%) with Deans Commendation Award
  * Student Ambassador; women in STEM advocate; resource development for educational access project

## The Turing Way (TTW) Collaborations, Alan Turing Institute (May 2023 – Ongoing)
  *	Developed the Turing Way’s research vision into executable tasks to deliver content for publication
  *	Represented TTW’s strategic contributions to the UK AI Landscape at the ATI Quinquennial Review
  *	Coordinated and organised onboarding calls and workshops to introduce new project members 

## Data Hazards, Ethics & Reproducibility Symposium, Alan Turing Institute (Dec 2022 – Mar 202)
  * Designed, co-organised and co-led a one-day, hybrid symposium to foster interdisciplinary discussions
  * Collaborated with Turing community teams to design and host an EDI-compliant, accessible event
  * Recruited and led a team of volunteers for hosting sessions, catering, and managing tasks
  * Collected feedback and identified improvements to revise the Grassroots Funding documentation

## AI Hopes and Fears Lab, British Library and Cambridge (Feb 2023)
  * Creatively engaged in two-way, open discussions with the public on the impact of AI in our daily lives  
  * Engaged with the AI Safety Summit’s People’s Panel discussing AI’s daily uses, risks, and implications, which they reported back to the UK Government as part of the AI Safety Summit
  * Collected data and public feedback regarding their lived experiences and understanding of AI to produce resources and to inform thinking on AI communications and accessibility
