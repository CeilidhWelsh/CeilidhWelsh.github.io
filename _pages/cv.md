PhD in Computational Oncology, University of Cambridge (Oct 2020 – Dec 2024) 

Thesis Title: Towards a Unified Model for Predicting Radiotherapy Effects 
Suprvised by [Dr Gillian C. Barnett](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/staff-directory/dr_gill_barnett/) and [Dr Raj Jena](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/staff-directory/dr-raj-jena/). 

* Utilised statistical and machine learning methods to predict radiotherapy treatment response, conducting collaborative interdisciplinary research with clinicians, AI researchers, ethicists, patients, and publics

*	Independently designed and implemented a reproducible pipeline using FAIR data principles, ensuring accountability, explainability, and transparency of algorithm development and research objectives

*	Mapped out and utilised ethical frameworks for evaluating and addressing medical data risks and ethical concerns associated with the project’s goals, in the context of AI healthcare implementation 

*	Shaped and informed the project’s execution through qualitative focus-group methods to explore patients’ lived experiences and perspectives

*	High-quality research outputs, from patient-facing collaborations to research publications, informing UK Government policy development on AI medical device regulation
