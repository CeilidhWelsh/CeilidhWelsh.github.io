About My Work
=============
**---**

I spend most of my time doing research analysis and visualisations using medical data anywhere from investigating common genetic variants to CT image biomarkers. I'm particularly interested in FAIR data principles, ethical data practices and how we can produce reproducible models and analysis pipelines across scientific fields.

My current work has ranged across a series of projects:

ðŸ§¬ Reproducible Pipeline for Biomarker Investigation: building a robust and reproducible modular pipeline for investigating biomarkers that ensures transparency and facilitates collaboration and validation of findings
ðŸ“š Contributing to Open Source Projects: see our research-group developed Python package scikit-rt
ðŸ“Š Data Ethics and Reproducibility: organizing a symposium on data ethics, contributing to open-access resources for data reproducibility and ethics, Data Hazards Project for an open-source vocabulary for data ethics, and participating in discussions and collaborations as part of community-led projects.
